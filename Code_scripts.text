Network setup commands
----------------------
To get things up and running finds here below are the procedural guide
commands
	
1) Mininet

  1.1) Installation
   - This is our network emulator tool we'll be using
   - To use it you can install it in a virtualized environment 
     on a VM or just a real machine. Use the commands below
   - Clone the git repository for minimap as shown
   
     	git clone git://github.com/mininet/mininet
     		
    - In the directory where we've cloned the repository, open it in the terminal then
    
    	cd mininet/util
    	
    - This takes us to the "util" directory. 
    - Therefore to get the mininet tool installed run the command
    
    	sudo ./install.sh -a
    	
    - This will prompt for root password. Enter the password to initiate installation
    
    - Alternatively the above can be executed in linux supported systems using the command
    
    	sudo apt install -y mininet

  1.2) Testing mininet
  	-To set up the network properies use the command
  	
  		sudo mn --switch ovsbr --test pingall
  		
  	- Enter the password when prompted and then the tool will automatically create the network
  	  together with the controllers and set the switches and links.	
  		
  1.3) Starting the mininet
  	- Use the command below to initiate the mininet tool console
  	
  		sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac â€“switch ovsk --controller remote
  		
  	- This results in the creation of the various network parameters which include;
  	      - 3 virtual hosts
  	      - openflow switch
  	      - set MAC address and configure the switch
  		
  		
2) Create a Learning Switch
   - Here we will use a controller platform of python based language POX.
   - Always comes packaged with mininet tool. If not available
   
  2.1) Installation
  	- Clone the git repo using the command
  	
  		$ git clone http://github.com/noxrepo/pox
  
  	- Run the test sample using the basic command
  	
  		$./pox.py log.level --DEBUG misc.of_tutorial
  	
  	- This sets up the local server access and ports
	


  2.2) Verify controller reachability
  
  	- In the mininet console environment
  	
  		mininet> pingall

	- Checks network connectivity sanity
