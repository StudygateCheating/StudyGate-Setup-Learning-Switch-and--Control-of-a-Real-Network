	Introduction
	-------------
	
	Virtualized systems and Software-defined networking protocols and standards have made it possible for simplified
	information sharing and control for communication in various entities from private, public, snall scale to large
	scale entities. 
	Using the SDN standards and OpenFlow(OF) protocols have necessitated control of network parameters from both controls,
	switches to routes and hubs be easily controlled programmatically using special instructions commands designed using
	various user friendly programming languages e. Java, Python, Ruby etc. 
	This has made it possible to as well design well formulated interfaces for network administraters management
	e.g POX control tool designed in Python provides interfaces for network configuration setting and control 
	summaries for easier management and control of network.
	Mininet tool provides virtualization for networks both in real machines and virtualized environment hence ease of 
	network provisioning for organizations and businesses. These collectively provides the following significance
	in network technology
	1) Improbed innovation and connectivity
	2) Improved network policy management
	3) Simplified network configuration and provisioning
	4) Automated control tools makes network monitoring more simplified
